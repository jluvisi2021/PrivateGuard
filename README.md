# PrivateGuard
 A C# based offline password manager for Windows.
# About
Private Guard is a one-man project I started July 11th, 2020.
The goal of Private Guard is to create a completely offline password manager that uses independent files with military-grade encryption while also remaining entirely open source.
Private Guard was created in Visual Studio 2019 as a WPF Application and is entirely constructed in C#.
I had very little previous experience with C# or making desktop applications before this.
# How to Use
In the Private Guard application there is a button called "How to Use" which will link you to a unlisted youtube video that I created that explains how to use the application.
# How to Use (2)
If you are still stuck you can refer to the Github Wiki page which also explains how to use this application as well as some common errors and Q&A.
# As of today
Private Guard is still in active development by me and I will continue to update Private Guard for a while until I am mostly satisfied with my work. This project has taught me a lot about designing desktop applications!
